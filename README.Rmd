## Overview

blockr is a framework for __data analysis__, using a __web-based__ point and click user interface.
Use blockr to create web apps that perform __visual programming__, leveraging the power of __R__.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.core from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.core")
```

## What is blockr.core?

`blockr.core` is the entry point to blockr, providing the core functionality needed to get started.
It can be run as a stand-alone app, but is designed with extensibility in mind.
A rich __API__ is provided to connect your own blocks and override the default behaviors (e.g., you can add your own GUI layer or serialization).

## What is a block?

A __block__ is a fundamental unit of a data analysis workflow.
A single block performs a single __task__, such as loading or filtering or visualization.
Blocks can be joined together using a __DAG__ (direct acyclic graph) to create powerful data __workflows__.

## Who is it for?

blockr targets two main user groups:

- __non developers__ are empowered to create insightful data workflows using pre-built blocks that can be __easily__ connected, all without writing a single line of code.
- __developers__ are provided with a set of tools to create new blocks and extend blockr, thereby enhancing the entire framework and fostering __collaboration__ within teams and organisations.


## Key features

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Build data pipelines with intuitive interface, like with [blockr.ui](https://cynkra.github.io/blockr.ui/).
2. **Flexibility**: Easily add, remove, or rearrange blocks in your pipeline.
3. **Extensibility**: Developers can create custom blocks to extend functionality ([blockr.dplyr](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.dplyr), [blockr.ai](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.ai), [blockr.io](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.io), [blockr.sdtm](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.sdtm), ...)
4. **Reproducibility**: Pipelines created with `blockr.core` are easily shareable and reproducible, with exportable code.
5. **Interactivity**: Real-time feedback as you build and modify your pipeline.

```{r blockr-ui, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='blockr.ui example', fig.align = 'center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/blockr-ui.png")
```

## Getting started

To get started, we invite you to read this [vignette](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.core/articles/get-started.html).

## Extending blockr

We started to build blockr extensions to enrich blockr.core's capabilities:

- [blockr.dplyr](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.dplyr): an entry point to the `dplyr` ecosystem.
- [blockr.ai](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.ai): LLM-powered blocks.
- [blockr.io](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.io): handle different data input format (xpt, csv, ...) and output for export.
- [blockr.sdtm](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.sdtm): pharmaverse datasets blocks.

If you wish to learn to develop your own blocks, have a look at this [vignette](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.core/articles/create-block.html).
