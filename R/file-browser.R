#' @section File browser block:
#' In order to make user data available to blockr, this block provides file-
#' upload functionality via [shiny::fileInput()]. Given that data provided in
#' this way are only available for the life-time of the shiny session, exported
#' code is not self-contained and a script containing code from an upload block
#' is cannot be run in a new session. Also, serialization of upload blocks is
#' currently not allowed as the full data would have to be included during
#' serialization.
